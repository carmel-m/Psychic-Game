# Psychic-Game

The game is working mostly as expected, but there are a few issues:

    - I haven't written anything that validates user input to make sure only letters go into the userGuesses array, or made sure that the same incorrect letter isn't added to the userGuesses array multiple times
    - The same incorrect guess can decrement guessesLeft multiple times
    - I would also like to add some CSS styling to the game.
